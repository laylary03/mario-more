This is my solution to the "more comfortable" version of the Mario pyramid challenge from [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), Week 1.

Prompt the user for a height (1â€“8), then print **two side-by-side pyramids** of that height with a gap of two spaces in the middle.

## ðŸ’¡ Concepts Used

- Nested `for` loops
